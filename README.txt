A project to continue developing skills.

The goal of this project is to see whether you can track a change in an artist's mental health over time by analyzing the lyrics in their discography. In particular, for (solo) artists that take their lives, is this evolving state of mind captured through the tone/use of words in their songs.

This is done by analyzing the amount of times "positive/happy words" are said by an artists in each song over the years and tracking these occurunces throughout their career.
